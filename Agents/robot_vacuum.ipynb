    "\n",
    "In this assignment you will implement a simulator environment for an automatic vacuum cleaner robot, a set of different reflex-based agent programs, and perform a comparison study for cleaning a single room. Focus on the __cleaning phase__ which starts when the robot is activated and ends when the last dirty square in the room has been cleaned. Someone else will take care of the agent program needed to navigate back to the charging station after the room is clean.\n",

    "## PEAS description of the cleaning phase\n",
    "\n",
    "__Performance Measure:__ Each action costs 1 energy unit. The performance is measured as the sum of the energy units used to clean the whole room.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Environment:__ A room with $n \\times n$ squares where $n = 5$. Dirt is randomly placed on each square with probability $p = 0.2$. For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size and the layout of the room (i.e., it knows $n$). To start, the agent is placed on a random square.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Actuators:__ The agent can clean the current square (action `suck`) or move to an adjacent square by going `north`, `east`, `south`, or `west`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sensors:__ Four bumper sensors, one for north, east, south, and west; a dirt sensor reporting dirt in the current square.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The agent program for a simple randomized agent\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent program is a function that gets sensor information (the current percepts) as the arguments. The arguments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A dictionary with boolean entries for the for bumper sensors `north`, `east`, `west`, `south`. E.g., if the agent is on the north-west corner, `bumpers` will be `{\"north\" : True, \"east\" : False, \"south\" : False, \"west\" : True}`.\n",
