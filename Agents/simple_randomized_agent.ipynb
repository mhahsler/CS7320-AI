    "__Environment:__ A room with $n \\times n$ squares where $n = 5$. Dirt is randomly placed on each square with probability $p = 0.2$. For simplicity, you can assume that the agent knows the size of the layout of the room (i.e., it knows n and where it starts).\n",

    "__Actuators:__ The agent can `clean` the current square or move to an adjacent square by going `north`, `east`, `west`, or `south`.\n",

    "__Sensors:__ Four bumper sensors, one for north`, `east`, `west`, and `south`; a dirt sensor reporting dirt in the current square.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest implementation for the environment is to hold an 2-dimensional array to represent if squares are clean or dirty and to call the agent function in a loop untill all squares are clean or a predefined number of steps have been reached.\n",

E.g., if the agent is on the north-west corner, `bumpers` gets `{\"north\" : True, \"west\" : True}` or if the agent is not close to a border then it gets `{}`.\n",

Implement a utility-based agent that maximizes the expected utility over one full charge which lasts for 10000 time steps. This is very tricky!"
