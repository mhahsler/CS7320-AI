# Chapter 7-9: Knowledge-based Agents

Knowledge-based agents store facts typically using logic. First-order logic is often performed using 
the dedicated logic programming language [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog). Here are two online examples using SWI-Prolog:

* [A Simple Prolog Knowledge Base.](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/example/kb.pl)
* [The n-Queens Problem as a Logic Problem.](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/example/queens.pl)

Python provides
several modules for logic and symbolic mathematics. Here is a 
short primer for 
* [Logic Programming with Python.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/artificial_intelligence_with_python/artificial_intelligence_with_python_logic_programming.htm)


Large language models (LLMs) are a type of knowledge-based agents that use natural language rather than logic. They can be used via an API or run locally:

* [OpenAI Python API Library.](https://github.com/openai/openai-python)
* [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) provides a large collection
  of downloadable pretrained LLMs with 
* [Prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering) from OpenAI.
