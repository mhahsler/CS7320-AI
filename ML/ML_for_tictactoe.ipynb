    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use machine learning (ML) to support intelligent agents playing Tic-Tac-Toe (see [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)). \n",
    "Games are sequential decision making problems that can be solved using heuristic tree search. \n",
    "Here we try to learn an evaluation function `eval()` that predicts the utility of a non-terminal board.\n",
    "The idea is to use supervised learning to train a regression model on training data created using simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Generating Function $f(\\cdot)$\n",
    "To apply supervised learning we assume that \n",
    "there exists a function $$y = f(x),$$\n",
    "with $y \\in [-1,1]$ that maps a board (state $s$) represented by the feature \n",
    "vector $x$ to the true utility of the state $U(s)$ given the playout policies that both players are using. \n",
    "For terminal states, we can observe a value for this function. But for non-terminal state, we need to learn an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual game outcomes in data that we observe depends not just on the current board but also on both \n",
    "   players' playout policies. \n",
    "   We call the two playout policies $\\pi_x$ and $\\pi_o$. \n",
    "   If the policies are stochastic, then the function $f(\\cdot)$ will also be stochastic. This means the same board can lead to a win (+1), a loss (-1) or a draw (0),\n",
    "   depending on what moves are chosen by the players.\n",
    "   One way to interpret this is to say that our observations have a random error or are noisy which is fine for ML. \n",
    "   For stochastic functions, we need to work with expectations. We model $$\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_x,\\pi_o}[U(s)] = y = f(x_s),$$ \n",
    "   with the\n",
    "   expectation taken over the two players' playout policies $\\pi_x$ and $\\pi_o$. For simple two-player, zero-sum games \n",
    "   it has been shown \n",
    "   that the expected state utility of random play is proportional to the expected utility under the optimal policies, so we can\n",
    "   use random playout policies. Essentially, better boards are more likely to lead to a win no matter the policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ML Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected utility is a continuous variable so we use regression.\n",
    "We want to learn a function to predict the expected utility: $$h(x_s) = \\hat{y} \\approx \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_x,\\pi_o}[U(s)].$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not expect a linear relationship, so linear regression will not work.\n",
    "For regression, we typically minimize the \n",
    "$L_2(\\hat{y}, y)$ loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Training Data\n",
    "We can create training data by observing (or simulating) games and recording all board positions as the \n",
    "   feature matrix $X$ and the information if they lead to a win, \n",
    "   loss or draw as the vector $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is typically generated using simulation which also uses a playout strategy. We will use a \n",
    "simple random policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "An even better approach would be to use \"self-play.\" Here the current ML model is used as the playout policy for two copies of the agent playing each other (it is called self-play because the agent basically plays itself). We update the models after each new game finishes and keep on playing. The idea is that the agent will generate better and better data to improve the model. Considerations for self-play including temporal credit assignment and the need to introduce variability into the process can be found in [Tesauro (1995)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/203330.203343).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the ML Model in the Agent \n",
    "The ML model can be used in intelligent agents in several ways:  \n",
    "   - We can choose an action in state $s$ by maximizing the predicted expected utility of the state after the action: $$a^* = \\mathrm{argmax}_{a \\in \\mathrm{available\\_actions}(s)}\\ h(\\mathrm{result}(s, a)).$$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   This is a direct application of the maximum \n",
    "   expected utility principle. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - We can use $$\\mathrm{eval(s)} = h(s)$$ as the heuristic evaluation function for heuristic minimax cutoff search.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first option is actually a special case of the second where the cutoff is 1."

    "## Some Concluding Notes \n",
    "\n",
    "* The learned evaluation function is not perfect.\n",
    "* Tic-tac-toe is easy and learning an evaluation function for more complex games can be a lot harder. It may require deep learning with convolution or constructing an embedding for the board.\n",
    "* We could create a stronger player by using the ML evaluation function in a **heuristic alpha-beta search.** \n",
    "* We could generate more (better) training data from observing the trained agent play and update the model. This is called approach is **self-play.**\n",
    "* The approach is very similar to the reinforcement learning (RL) method called **neural fitted Q-learning (NFQ)**. In RL, the utility for taking an action in a state is called a Q-value $Q(s,a) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_x,\\pi_o}[U(result(s,a))]$ and the training set is called a replay memory.  "
