    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "We want to use machine learning (ML) to support intelligent agents playing Tic-Tac-Toe (see [rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)). \n",
    "Games are sequential decision making problems that can be solved using heuristic tree search. \n",
    "Here we try to learn an evaluation function `eval()` that predicts the utility of a non-terminal board.\n",
    "The idea is to use supervised learning to train a regression model on training data created using simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply supervised learning we assume that \n",
    "there exists a function $$y = f(x)$$ with $y \\in [-1,1]$ that maps a board (state $s$) represented by the feature \n",
    "vector $x$ to the true utility of the state $U(s)$ given the policy that both players are using. For terminal states, we know the value for this function. But for non-terminal state, we need to learn an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual game outcomes in data that we observe depends not just on the current board but also on both \n",
    "   players' playout policies. If the policies are stochastic, then the function $f$ will also be stochastic. This means the same board can lead to a win (+1), a loss (-1) or a draw (0),\n",
    "   depending on what moves are randomly chosen.\n",
    "   One way to interpret this is to say that our observations have a random error or are noisy which is fine for ML. \n",
    "   For stochastic functions, we need to work with expectations. We model \n",
    "   $$\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_x,\\pi_o}[U(s)] = y = f(x_s)$$ \n",
    "   with the\n",
    "   expectation taken over the two players' playout policies $\\pi_x$ and $\\pi_o$. For simple two-player, zero-sum games \n",
    "   it has been shown \n",
    "   that the expected state utility of random play is proportional to the expected utility under the optimal policies, so we can\n",
    "   use random playout policies. Essentially, better boards are more likely to lead to a win no matter the policy. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can create training data by observing (or simulating) games and recording all board positions as the \n",
    "   feature matrix $X$ and the information if they lead to a win, \n",
    "   loss or draw as the vector $y$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regression can now learn a function \n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}_{\\pi_x,\\pi_o}[\\hat{U}(s)] = \\hat{y} = h(x_s)$$ \n",
    "where during learning we will minimize\n",
    "$L_2(\\hat{y}, y)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ML model can be used in intelligent agents in several ways.   \n",
    "   - We can choose an action in state $s$ by \n",
    "   $$a^* = \\mathrm{argmax}_{a \\in \\mathrm{available\\_actions}(s)} \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{U}(\\mathrm{result}(s, a))].$$ \n",
    "   This is a direct application of the maximum \n",
    "   expected utility principle. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   - We can use $$\\mathrm{eval(s)} = \\mathbb{E}[\\hat{U}(s)]$$ as the heuristic evaluation function for Heuristic Minimax Search.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is typically generated using simulation which also uses a playout strategy. We will use a \n",
    "simple random policy. An even better approach would be to use \"self-play.\" Here the current ML model is used as the playout policy for two copies of the agent playing each other (it is called self-play because the agent basically plays itself). We update the models after each new game finishes and keep on playing. The idea is that the agent will generate better and better data to improve the model. Considerations for self-play including temporal credit assignment and the need to introduce variability into the process can be found in [Tesauro (1995)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/203330.203343)."
